                                <p>In the year of Our Lord 1403, the Holy Roman Empire was in ruins. In the wake of the Black Death came new calamities. While two popes vied for power, the heir to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire, Wenceslaus IV, was more occupied with drinking, hunting and dallying with chambermaids than with affairs of state, and soon chaos was rife.

                                <p>Then King Wenceslaus was abducted by his brother Sigismund, King of Hungary, to force him to take the Emperor’s crown or give up his throne. All this ended in war, a long, peculiar war, today little spoken of, for it had no epic battles, clear victors or great heroes. But villains, cut-throats and pawns sacrificed to their masters‘ intrigues were, like in all wars, a-plenty. Come, let’s tell of it…</p>

                                <p>Folk tell it was Sigismund’s Hungarian mercenaries who laid siege to Kuttenberg. They came to rob the silver mines and because our master Sir Radzig holds allegiance to Wenceslaus.</p>
