                                <p><b>In the year of Our Lord 1403, the Holy Roman Empire was in ruins. In the wake of the Black Death came new calamities. While two popes vied for power, the heir to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire, Wenceslaus IV, was more occupied with drinking, hunting and dallying with chambermaids than with affairs of state, and soon chaos was rife. So the German King Rupert III laid claim to the Imperial crown, the nobles fell to squabbling and hatching plots, and reprobates of every kind crawled out from under rocks and set to pillaging. Preachers proclaimed the End of the World was nigh…!</b></p>

                                <p><i>Then King Wenceslaus was abducted by his brother Sigismund, King of Hungary,</i> to force him to take the Emperor’s crown or give up his throne. All this ended in war, a long, peculiar war, today little spoken of, for it had no epic battles, clear victors or great heroes. But villains, cut-throats and pawns sacrificed to their masters‘ intrigues were, like in all wars, a-plenty. Come, let’s tell of it…</p>

                                <p><strong>Charles IV, King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor,</strong> had a long and successful reign. The Empire he ruled from Prague expanded, and his subjects lived in peace and prosperity.

                                        When he died, the whole Empire mourned. More than 7,000 people accompanied him on his last procession.

                                        The heir to the throne of the flourishing Empire was Charles' son, Wenceslas IV, whose father had prepared him for this moment all his life. But Wenceslas did not take after his father. He neglected affairs of state for more frivolous pursuits. He even failed to turn up for his own coronation as Emperor, which did little to endear him to the Pope. Wenceslas "the Idle" did not impress the Imperial nobility either.

                                        His difficulties mounted until the nobles, exasperated by the inaction of their ruler, turned for help to his half-brother, King Sigismund of Hungary. Sigismund decided on a radical solution. He kidnapped the King to force him to abdicate, then took advantage of the ensuing disorder to gain greater power for himself. He invaded Bohemia with a massive army and began pillaging the territories of the King's allies.
